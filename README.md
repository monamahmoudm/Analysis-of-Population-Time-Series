# Analysis-of-Population-Time-Series
### Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of our analysis is to observe the population trend over the years in the US and forecast the population for the next 5 years. Forecasting the U.S. population offers significant benefits across various sectors, enhancing strategic planning and resource allocation. For government agencies, accurate population projections inform policy development and implementation in healthcare, education, infrastructure, and social services, ensuring resources are effectively distributed and future needs anticipated. Economically, population forecasts are crucial for labor market analysis, consumer demand predictions, housing market trends, and long-term growth strategies, guiding businesses in market analysis and strategic planning. Urban and regional planners rely on these forecasts to design sustainable environments, including housing, transportation, and public utilities, while healthcare planners use them to ensure systems can meet future demands, manage public health, and address challenges like aging populations. In education, forecasting helps plan for school capacities, staffing, and funding needs. Overall, population forecasting supports informed decision-making and strategic planning across multiple domains, fostering a well-prepared and adaptable society.


### Dataset Description
This dataset, sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, is hosted by the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED), which maintains and updates its information based on incoming data. It records the population data in the US. For national population data from 1900 to 1949, the figures exclude residents of Alaska and Hawaii. From 1940 to 1979, the data includes the resident population plus Armed Forces overseas. For all other years, only the resident population is covered.
We obtained the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/census/population-time-series-data?select=POPH.csv )
The dataset contains 4 columns and 99 observations. The four variables are realtime_start, value, date, and realtime_end. The value variable records the population at the beginning of each year. The date variable shows the date of the observation and is recorded once at the beginning of every year from 1900 to 1999.
